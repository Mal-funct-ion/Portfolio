This game was made following the Godot Documentation. The assets and majority of the code were not created by me but rather by following the Godot Documentation at: link: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html. The code and parts of project which I created are the Acknowledgement present in the beginning of the game. 

In this game the primary goal is to avoid mobs as they approach towards without getting hit.

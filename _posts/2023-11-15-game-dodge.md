This game was made following the Godot Documentation. The assets and majority of the code were created by following the [Godot Documentation][tutorial]. The code and parts of project which I created are the Acknowledgement present in the beginning of the game.   
   
In this game the primary goal is to avoid mobs as they approach towards without getting hit.

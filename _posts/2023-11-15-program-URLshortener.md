This program is a web-based URL shortener that inputs a link and returns to the user a unique link that works similarly to the inputted one (Concept is very similar to that of Bit.ly).

In this program, the html code, Hexidecimal Decoder and base-64 encoder were provided. The rest of the program logic such as the writing and reading to and from files to returning the generated code was done by me.

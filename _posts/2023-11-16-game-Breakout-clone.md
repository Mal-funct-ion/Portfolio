This game is a clone of the popular game Breakout on the Atari 2600. The game was made using the in game physics engine with scripts developed by me. No tutorial was used outside of looking through Godot Documentation to look for certain methods and features  
  
In this game the primary goal is to bounce a ball back at targets in order to break them while preventing the ball from going past the paddle.

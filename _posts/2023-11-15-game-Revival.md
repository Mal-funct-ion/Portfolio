This game was made as part of a class project for Intro to Game Studies. This small demo was made from scratch on Unity as the basis for a top-down 2D game. The gameplay implemented was not meant to be final as another member had made the basis for our 'combat system'. 

**Info Notice:**
The project was originally saved in school servers and has since been wiped which unfortunately means I no longer have access to the project or code files. Music and Assets were not made by me. Level Design was made in conjunction with group mates.

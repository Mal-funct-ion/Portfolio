This game was made following the Godot Documentation. The assets and majority of the code were created by following the [Godot Documentation][tutorial] The code and parts of project which I created are the Acknowledgement present in the beginning of the game. 

In this game the primary goal is to avoid mobs as they approach towards without getting hit while also jumping and squishing the mobs to gain points.

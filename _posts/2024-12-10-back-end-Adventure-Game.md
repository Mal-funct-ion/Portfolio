This project was done in conjunction with a partner, Lilli Sanchez-Ayala(Class of 2024), as the final project for CMSC 455: Back End Development.

The project is a text-based adventure game, similar to that of *Colossal Cave Adventure*(1976). The goal for the player is to explore all 9 locations and gather coins by checking for items in each area. Some locations have chests and others have their corresponding keys to unlock them. The game is considered complete when all 9 areas have been visited with the player having an option to reset their game.

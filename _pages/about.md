My name is Hugo Agatep and I am current Junior at Lawrence University majoring in Computer Science and Geoscience. I was born and raised in the Philippines up until I moved
to the US to complete high school and pursue my Bachelor's Degree. As an aspiring game dev, I love games and programming. From JRPGs to RTS games to Action-Adventure, I've played a wide variety of games and have experience with a wide variety of gameplay styles and systems. I've also had experience with coding since 2016 and have learned how to use a few programming languages including Python, C/C++ and C#. 
  
This small website serves as my portfolio for the different games and programs I've had a hand in, whether they be for school work or a personal project, including future projects I make. This page will be where you can check out my current working project. To learn more about what courses I've taken, check out this [page][courses]. 

**Current Project:** Right now, I plan on working on a different variation of the Breakout clone using vector based Math to compute the ball direction rather than rely on the in-engine based physics. I also plan on locating more old projects to include in this portfolio.
